## How it works

1. Open the "Connect Library" section
2. Show your QR code to your friend, or scan theirs
3. Once connected, you can browse each other's catalogs
4. You can also request to borrow books

## Secure connection

The connection between libraries is end-to-end encrypted. Only the books you choose to share are visible to your contacts.
