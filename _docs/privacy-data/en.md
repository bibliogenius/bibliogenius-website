Your library data is stored locally on your device. When you connect with friends, only the books you choose to share are visible to them. You can export a backup anytime from your Profile.

## Local storage

All your data (books, shelves, loans, contacts) is stored in a local database on your device. Nothing is sent to a remote server.

## Controlled sharing

When you connect with other libraries, you maintain full control over what is shared. Only the books you choose to make visible are visible.

## Backups

Export a backup of all your data at any time from the Profile section. You can also re-import them when switching devices.

## Encryption

Communications between libraries are end-to-end encrypted (E2EE). Your data stays private.
