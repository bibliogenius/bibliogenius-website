Shelves let you classify your books by theme, genre or any other criteria.

## Create and manage shelves

1. Create thematic shelves for your books (e.g., "SciFi", "Favorites").
2. In your Library, tap a shelf to filter.
3. Tap the Sort icon to enter reorder mode.
4. Drag books to your preferred order, or tap A-Z for auto-sort by author.
5. Tap the checkmark to save your arrangement!

## Assign books to shelves

From a book's detail page, you can assign it to one or more shelves. A single book can appear on multiple shelves.

## Reorder books

Switch to reorder mode to change the order of books by drag-and-drop, or use auto-sort (by author, title, date added).
