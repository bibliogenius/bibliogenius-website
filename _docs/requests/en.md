In "Requests", you can see all incoming borrow requests (people wanting your books) and outgoing ones (your requests to others). Accept, decline, or mark as returned.

## Incoming requests

When someone wants to borrow one of your books, you receive a request. You can:

- **Accept** the request and lend the book
- **Decline** the request

## Outgoing requests

Track the status of your own borrow requests to other libraries.

## Returns

When a book is returned, mark it as "Returned" to update your library.
