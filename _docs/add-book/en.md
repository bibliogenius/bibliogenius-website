## Scan a barcode

Open the app and tap the "+" button at the bottom right, then choose "Scan".

Point your camera at the book's barcode. BiblioGenius recognizes it automatically and fetches all metadata (title, author, cover, etc.).

## Search by title or ISBN

You can also search for a book by its title or ISBN number:

1. Tap "+" then "Search"
2. Enter the title, author or ISBN
3. Select the right result from the list
4. The book is added with all its information

## Manual entry

If the book is not found in the catalogs, you can create it manually by filling in the title, author, and other fields.
