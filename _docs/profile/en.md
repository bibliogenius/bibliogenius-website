## Reading statistics

View a summary of your activity: number of books read, pages covered, estimated reading time, and progress toward your goals.

## Badges and rewards

Unlock badges by reaching reading milestones. Each completed book earns you XP, and you level up as you read more.

## Personal goals

Set a yearly reading goal. Your profile displays your real-time progress and encourages you to reach your target.

## Friend leaderboard

Compare your progress with your contacts. The leaderboard updates automatically when you are connected with other libraries.

## Backup export

From your profile, you can export a full backup of all your data (books, shelves, loans, contacts). Useful when switching devices.
