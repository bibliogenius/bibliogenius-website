# -- Hero --
hero_title: You have 200&nbsp;books<br>at&nbsp;home.
hero_p1: You know you lent <em>Les Misérables</em> to someone. But to&nbsp;whom?
hero_p2: You're at the bookshop, a novel catches your eye, and you hesitate: <em>"Do I already have this one?"</em>
hero_p3: And tonight, your neighbour rings the doorbell: <em>"Do you have a good book I could borrow?"</em>
hero_p4: Good question. Maybe you do. Somewhere. On a shelf. Or at someone's&nbsp;place.

# -- The problem --
ch_problem: The issue
problem_title: The problem
problem_p1: Today, managing a personal library means a notebook at best, total oblivion at worst.
problem_p2: And the existing apps? They centralise your data on their servers. Your reading habits, your tastes... everything is analysed, monetised, locked behind an account.
problem_p3: <strong>If the app shuts down tomorrow, your library vanishes with it.</strong>

# -- Agitation --
ch_agit: What it means
agit_title: In practice
agit_p1: Imagine: you've spent three years building your catalogue online. 500&nbsp;books. Notes, custom shelves, carefully tracked loans.
agit_p2: One morning, the app changes its terms of service. Or worse: it shuts down.
agit_p3: Everything evaporates. Three years of work. Gone.
agit_p4: And even when everything works, you can't <em>truly</em> lend a book to a friend. You can "recommend" a title.
quote1: Recommending is not sharing.<br>It's not the same as handing a book to someone and saying: <em>Here, you'll love this.</em>

# -- Solution --
ch_solution: The answer
solution_title: The library that truly belongs&nbsp;to&nbsp;you
solution_p1: Scan a barcode. The book appears with its cover, summary, and detailed information.
solution_p2: Organise your reads. Track your loans. Instantly find out who borrowed what.
solution_p3: And above all: <strong>your data stays on your phone.</strong> No account required. No remote server. No ads.
solution_p4: Your library works even without internet. It's yours, full stop.
solution_p5: What if you change phones? One tap to save everything, one tap to restore. Your books follow you, always.

# -- Wow moment --
ch_wow: Sharing
wow_title: The moment everything&nbsp;changes
wow_p1: Now, imagine something else.
wow_p2: Your friend Sophie also has BiblioGenius. You scan her QR&nbsp;code. In one second, her library appears on your phone.
wow_p3: No cloud needed. No middleman. No need to be on the same "social network."
quote2: It's as if she opened the door to her library and said: <em>Help yourself.</em>
wow_p4: You see she has <em>Dune</em>. You request a loan. She accepts. The app tracks everything: who has the book, since when, and when it should come back.
wow_p5: <strong>Peer-to-peer lending.</strong> Direct, simple, human. No algorithm deciding. Just two people sharing a passion.

# -- Vision --
ch_vision: The vision
vision_title: Why BiblioGenius exists
vision_p1: Because we believe <strong>your books belong to you</strong>. Not to a company.
vision_p2: Because real sharing is a direct gesture between two people, not a "recommend" button on a platform.
vision_p3: Because a library should be a neighbourhood commons, not an exploited database.
vision_coda: BiblioGenius is a citizen-led, open-source project, developed in Europe, supported by its community. Tomorrow, it will connect the book boxes on your street, your local reading club, and the library in your building.
